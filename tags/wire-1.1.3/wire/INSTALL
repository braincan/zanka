PREREQUISITES
=============

To install Wire, you need the following prerequisites:

    1. OpenSSL Library
       http://www.openssl.org/source/

    2. GNU libiconv
       http://www.gnu.org/software/libiconv/

    3. GNU readline

These are usually distributed with operating systems.


INSTALLATION
============

To install Wire, follow these instructions:

    1. Unpack the tarball:

         tar -xzf wire-X.X.tar.gz
         cd wire-X.X.tar.gz

    2. Run the configuration script:

         ./configure

       This will install Wire into /usr/local/bin by default. To
       change this, instead run:

         ./configure --prefix=PATH

    3. Run make. Note, GNU make is required.

         gmake

    4. If make is successful, install the software:

         gmake install

       This will require write permissions to /usr/local/bin, or
       whatever directory you set as the prefix above.


RUNNING

To start Wire, simply run:

    wire

Hotline to Wired account converter
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm hl2wired account/UserData
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm hl2wired
reads and converts Hotline account files and converts them to the equivalent Wired user entries for use with
.Xr wired 8 .
The program prints the converted records on standard output, for easy redirection directly into the
.Xr wired 8
`users' file. For example:
.Pp
.Dl hl2wired accounts/*/UserData >> /usr/local/wired/users
.Pp
This converts all the users found under `accounts', and adds them to the
.Xr wired 8
`users' file.
.Sh AUTHORS
.Nm wired
and the Wired protocol were developed by Axel Andersson.

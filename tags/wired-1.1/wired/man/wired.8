.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm wired
.Op Fl Dllhtuv
.Op Fl d Ar server_root
.Op Fl f Ar config_file
.Op Fl L Ar log_file
.Op Fl s Ar syslog_facility
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm wired
is the Wired server program, implementing the Wired chat and file transfer protocol. It is designed to run as a standalone server. On startup,
.Nm wired
will read the specified configuration file, bind to the specified ports and listen for connections. It is recommended that
.Xr wiredctl 1
is used to control the starting and stopping of 
.Nm wired .
.Pp
.Nm wired
also includes a very limited implementation of the Hotline protocol to provide support for platforms where there as of yet does not exist a Wired client. The implementation is, as of now, limited to chat only, but may be expanded in the future.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl D
Enable debug mode.
.Nm wired
will remain in the foreground, and log messages will echo to standard error.
.It Fl d Ar server_root
Specify the root path.
.Nm wired
will attempt to locate its required files under this directory, and
.Xr chroot 2
to it unless
.Fl u
is specified.
.It Fl f Ar config_file
Specify the path of the configuration file, relative to
.Va server_root .
The default is
.Pa etc/wired.conf .
.It Fl h
Display a brief help message and exit.
.It Fl L
Specify the path of the file that
.Nm wired
will log to. Without it,
.Xr syslog 3
will be used according to the
.Fl s
flag.
.It Fl l
Increase the log level. Without it, logging is limited to connects and disconnect. Used once, file transfers are also logged. Used twice, also logs user operations such as kicks, account edits, etc.
.It Fl s Ar syslog_facility
Specifiy the syslog facility to use for logging. See
.Xr syslog.conf 5
for information on possible values. The default is
.Va daemon .
.It Fl t
Run a configuration syntax test and exit.
.It Fl u
By default
.Nm wired
will
.Xr chroot 2
to the
.Va server_root
path. This flag disables this behaviour.
.Pp
As a result of the default secure behaviour,
.Nm wired
cannot access any objects outside
.Va server_root
- this security measure is taken in case
.Nm wired
is compromised.
.It Fl v
Display version information and exit.
.El
.Sh CONFIGURATION FILE
.Nm wired
reads configuration data from
.Va config_file .
The file format and configuration options are described in
.Xr wired.conf 5 .
.Sh FILES
The locations of these files can be configured in
.Va config_file ,
this list describes the default locations. All files are contained within the
.Va server_root
path.
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Pa etc/wired.conf
Configuration data for
.Nm wired .
The file format and configuration options are described in
.Xr wired.conf 5 .
.It Pa etc/certificate.pem
The OpenSSL certificate as described in
.Xr req 1 .
.It Pa banlist
A newline separated list of banned IPs. Subnet notation (192.168.0.0/16 or 192.168.0.0/255.255.0.0) and wildcards (192.168.*.*) are recognized.
.It Pa files/
A directory containing all files that are publically available to connected users.
.It Pa groups
A newline separated list of groups. Each line consists of colon separated fields with the following meanings:
.Pp
.Dl name
.Dl can get user info
.Dl can broadcast
.Dl can post news
.Dl can clear news

and others to display some statistics. The file is a series of space separated numbers with the following meanings:
.Pp
.Dl time of startup
.Dl number of online users
.Dl total number of users
.Dl number of active downloads
.Dl total number of downloads
.Dl number of active uploads
.Dl total number of uploads

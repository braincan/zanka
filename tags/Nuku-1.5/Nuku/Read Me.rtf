\f0\b\fs28 \cf2 Nuku FAQ

\f0\b \cf2 Q. What is Nuku?
\f1\b0 \cf0 \
A. Nuku is a personal Japanese tutor, teaching you the two native Japanese writing systems, hiragana and katakana. It features both these systems, all three main romanization systems and methods of selecting what to learn. It was written to aid me in my Japanese studies.\
\

\f0\b \cf2 Q.  Where should I send the check?
\f1\b0 \cf0 \
A. Nuku is freeware and open source. You are free to use this as permitted in the license. I do like feedback though, you can reach me at morris@animanga.nu.\
\

\f0\b \cf2 Q. What are romanization systems?
\f1\b0 \cf0 \
AThere are several methods of romanizing Japanese. The three main ones are Hepburn, Kunreisiki and Nihonsiki.\
\
The official system is Kunreisiki. Another, Hepburn, was designed to romanize according to pronouciation, rather than a fixed table. Nihonsiki is similar to Kunreisiki.\
\

\f0\b \cf2 Q. What is hiragana? And what about this katakana thing?
\f1\b0 \cf0 \
A. Hiragana and katakana are two alphabets of sorts in Japanese, the third then being kanji. Hiragana and katakana are much more like our alphabet than kanji is though, as there are about 70 unique characters - there are several thousand kanji.\
\
Hiragana is the first thing a Japanese learns in school, and every word can be written using them. It would look odd to a Japanese, without all the kanji, but they'd figure it out. Katakana is similar to hiragana but looks different. It is used instead of the latter, when writing foreign words, or for extra emphasis.\
\

\f0\b \cf2 Q. Nuku tells me that 'zu' is incorrect and that 'zu' was the correct answer, what's up with that?
\f1\b0 \cf0 \
A. Take a look at the buttons of Nuku, while using either Hepburn or Kunreisiki. Notice how two buttons have the same title? In fact, it's two different characters, with the same sound and romanization. Confusing? Yep. Hard to implement? You bet.\
\
There is no perfect solution to this, other than knowing this fact yourself when you click around. Oh, and Nihonsiki does not have this problem either.\

\f0\b \cf2 \
1.2.5
\f1\b0 \cf0 \
- When using text field input and timeout enabled, Nuku will now clear the text field if the user runs out of time (thanks Jens)\
\

\f0\b \cf2 1.2.4
\f1\b0 \cf0 \
- Sticky character feature added, when incorrect, Nuku will stay at the last kana till the user presses a key or hits a button\
- Mixed mode added, randomly selects hiragana and katakana for tutoring\
\

\f0\b \cf2 1.2.3
\f1\b0 \cf0 \
- Ability to easily switch between hiragana and katakana without reseting score board, i.e. see counterpart in Learning Mode without retyping/reclicking desired kana\
- Included Mac OS 9 link to source code and renamed "GPL" to "LICENSE"\
- Moved Lines To Test command to Nuku menu\
- Check for host platform to see whether to include Quit command in File or not, for OS9 people running Carbon version, which is not really recommended, as the interface in that version is adjusted for the Aqua window manager, explaining the wide buttons, etc, you can download a native Classic version from <http://www.zankasoftware.com/>\
\

\f0\b \cf2 1.2.2
\f1\b0 \cf0 \
- Carbon version resynched with Classic code, works equally well under OSX\
- Incorporated the GNU General Public License and released source code under it\
- About box would produce some really weird results and then crash the second time it was opened, fixed (thanks Chris)\
- Other minor bug fixes I think I did while partially unconscious, and therefore are missing from the version history\
- Updated and restructured this document\
\

\f0\b \cf2 1.2.1
\f1\b0 \cf0 \
- Added feature to select a timeout for answers in quiz mode \'d1 when this time has passed without a given answer, it is considered incorrect and the application moves on to the next kana (Cheers to wataru)\
- Increased heap's maybe slightly optimistic size in response to memory related crash issues (Thanks Michael, first to report)\
- Bug fix: slightly misplaced checkboxes in "Lines To Test" window (Thanks Jeff)\
- Bug fix: no deactivation of Tutor window when doing Edit->Lines To Test with Lines To Test window already open fixed\
\

\f1\b0 \cf0 \
- All new About box, 32-bit OS X savvy icons and web page in cute style, all thanks to pixel wiz manji\
- You can now choose between buttons and a text field for input\
- Moved most preferences to Nuku menu with keyboard equivalents for easier access; "Lines To Test" remains as a dialog\
- Optimizations and leak stoppage has taken the memory requirement down to a mere 192 kB, Carbon version requires much more and is now at 612 kB\
- Added "Select All" button in new "Lines To Test" dialog; removed "Defaults\'c9" button\
- Carbon fix: no "Quit" under File menu in Mac OS X, it is supplied by the system\
- Bug fix: Fixed the close preferences save dialog, which for some unknown reason had disappeared\
- Bug fix: Floating point in score board is back and might even work this time\

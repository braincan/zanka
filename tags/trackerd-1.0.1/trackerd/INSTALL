PREREQUISITES
=============

To install the Wired tracker, you need the following prerequisites:

    1. OpenSSL Library
       http://www.openssl.org/source/
    
These are usually distributed with operating systems.


INSTALLATION
============

To install the Wired tracker, follow these instructions:

    1. Unpack the tarball:
    
         tar -xzf wired-tracker-X.X.tar.gz
         cd wired-tracker-X.X.tar.gz
    
    2. Run the configuration script:
    
         ./configure
       
       This will install the Wired tracker into /usr/local by default. To
       change this, instead run:
       
         ./configure --prefix=/path
       
       To change the default user the installation will write files as,
       run:
       
         ./configure --with-user=USER
     
    3. Run make. Note, GNU make is required.
    
         gmake
       
    4. If make is successful, install the software:
    
         gmake install
       
       This will require write permissions to /usr/local/wired, or
       whatever directory you set as the prefix above.


RUNNING
=======

To start an installed Wired tracker, run:

    /usr/local/wired/trackerdctl start
